Ok, so you're probably wondering why the hell I put a pointer to an SDL_Renderer inside the object list. 
The reason for this is because the SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface function we use to import the images to 
the objects requires a pointer to an SDL_Renderer. Now, I already have an SDL_Renderer on the 
SVideoContext structure, but if I include video.h on objects.h, since objects.h is included on video.h, 
we get an infinite #include loop which drives GCC up the wall. So, my temporary hack for this is having
a pointer to SDL_Renderer inside each object list.

Now, let me be clear: Please, do NOT allocate a Renderer for each object list. You're supposed to set
the pointer to the SDL_Renderer you have in your SVideoContext structure. I'm not sure of what the
consequences would be of allocating an SDL_Renderer for each object list (and frankly, I really don't
want to know) so please don't do it.
